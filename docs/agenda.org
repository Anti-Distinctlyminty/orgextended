* Agenda
  The Agenda in org allows you to use scheduling markers on a task to help visualize
  your goals for the day. The agenda is really a collection of aggregate filtered views
  on a subset of your todo's.

  Like most things in orgextended the agenda is a work in progress, and currently quite a mess
  That said, there are some very useful pieces already present in the system.  

  - Space on any item in the agenda will open that item in a seperate group.
  - Enter on any item in the agenda will open that item in the current group.
  - Ctrl+w will close the agenda view.
  - The habit visualizer leaves something to be desired, it does not yet support the restart options that most habits
    do in org, BUT, it is still present and gives you a semblance of how well you are tracking with your habits.
