* Agenda
  The Agenda in org allows you to use scheduling markers on a task to help visualize
  your goals for the day. The agenda is really a collection of aggregate filtered views
  on a subset of your todo's.

  Like most things in orgextended the agenda is a work in progress, and currently quite a mess
  That said, there are some very useful pieces already present in the system.  

  - Space on any item in the agenda will open that item in a seperate group.
  - Enter on any item in the agenda will open that item in the current group.
  - Ctrl+w will close the agenda view.
  - The habit visualizer leaves something to be desired, it does not yet support the restart options that most habits
    do in org, BUT, it is still present and gives you a semblance of how well you are tracking with your habits.

** Notifications
   OrgExtended has the start of a notification system. It is not yet super stable.
   However, the notification thread is a background system that starts up when OrgExtended starts.
   It will do the following:

   - Start when sublime starts.
   - Scan all files in your agenda list and build a model of scheduled tasks for today.
   - Periodically rebuild that task list.
   - Periodically detect approaching tasks and attempt to notify you.

   The system as it currently stands is not very configurable, but that will change.
   The system currently is hard coded to do 2 things:

   - Show a full screen view with your current notifications for today.
   - On Windows: Run showballoontip.ps1 to pop up a windows notification about your impending event.

   Eventually I hope that this system can be made much more flexible and work on various platforms. 
   For now, this is what we have.
