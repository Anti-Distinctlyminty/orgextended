* The Clock
  Tasks are powerful by themselves but org takes project planning even deeper.
  Org has a wonderful triad of features to help you with personal project planning and consulting.
  These are:

  - [x] Clocking
  - [x] Clock reports
  - [x] Estimates
  - [ ] Column Mode

  I know I said triad, but I don't have column mode implemented yet and it will likely be a while
  as I work to figure out how best to make that a reality.

  These features work together to allow you to estimate your expected time on a task, clock in and out
  as you work on the tasks and build reports that delineate how your estimates stacked up against your
  actual expenditures of time. For those of us that are always looking to grow in our project management
  skills, disciplined use of the clock is powerful ally.

  For those of us working as consultants or in other industries where a time sheet can be valuable 
  the clock reports can be a huge benefit.

** Clocking

  Org has the ability to start and stop a clock and record the elapsed time in your property drawer.
  While Org allows you to record your clock values anywhere in a heading, I have avoided that.
  Not only is it easier searching for clocked values in a property drawer, but my bias is showing here
  in that I prefer storing my clock values in the property drawer. Perhaps if someone else has the time to
  lend a hand in the future we can support the other means of editing properties.


** Clock Reports
   
   Clock reports are nothing more that a dynamic block that builds a text table showing how you have
   spent your time.
