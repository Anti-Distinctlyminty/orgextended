* TODO Capture
  The ability to capture an idea really quickly is a very powerful feature of
  org mode. Bind ~OrgCapture~ to a hotkey. (By default the neovintageous binding is shift+Z)
  Once bound this allows you to make very quick captures of ideas as they come to you.

  Right now, the capture mechanism ONLY supports capturing to a refile file.
  That is because, that is my primary way of using the feature. Capture into
  an inbox that I refile every day or so when I have a moment.

  In the future I might support other mechanisms of capturing. Org
  has the ability to capture to a datetree for things like regular meetings,
  capturing to the active clocked item. Capturing to IDed or tagged items.
  Capturing to specific entries in specific files and a host of other options.

* TODO Refile
  I like to capture ideas, snippets and meeting notes to my refile file.
  That makes input quick and dirty when I am in the middle of something else.

  However, once captured it is a pain to move that stuff around. Org has a 
  feature that lets you do that much easier. Refile. ~OrgRefile~ lets you
  quickly move a heading from one location to another within your known
  org files. 

* TODO Archive
  While projects are great, it is often useful to archive
  a project once completed. Org has a powerful toolset for
  archiving completed subtrees.

  *OrgArchiveSubtree* will take the subtree and put it in another file
  as an archived entry.

  As usual the org manual is the best source of truth about archiving:

  That said a quick primer:

  You can either add 
  TODO FILL IN FROM HERE
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
  #+END_EXAMPLE
