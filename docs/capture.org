* TODO Capture
  The ability to capture an idea really quickly is a very powerful feature of
  org mode. Bind ~OrgCapture~ to a hotkey. (By default the neovintageous binding is shift+Z)
  Once bound this allows you to make very quick captures of ideas as they come to you.

  Right now, the capture mechanism ONLY supports capturing to a refile file.
  That is because, that is my primary way of using the feature. Capture into
  an inbox that I refile every day or so when I have a moment.

  In the future I might support other mechanisms of capturing. Org
  has the ability to capture to a datetree for things like regular meetings,
  capturing to the active clocked item. Capturing to IDed or tagged items.
  Capturing to specific entries in specific files and a host of other options.

** Capture By Template
  While I do have a very simplistic template mechanism, I decided after starting to
  implement that, that I would rather use snippets.

  A capture entry is specified something like so: 

  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    "captureTemplates":
    [
        {
            "name":    "Capture",
            "type":    "entry",
            "snippet": "capture_heading",
            "target": ["file","{refile}"],
        },
    ]
  #+END_SRC

  This states that when you run the Capture option, we will paste the
  capture_heading.sublime-snippet file into the capture buffer for your to edit.

  I have extended the snippet environment to include additional variables and will
  continue to extend the list as there is need:

  - ORG_INACTIVE_DATE :: An inactive date block at the current date
  - ORG_ACTIVE_DATE :: An active date block at the current date
  - ORG_DATE :: Just the current date
  - ORG_TIME :: Just the current time.
  - ORG_CLIPBOARD :: The current contents of the clipboard
  - ORG_SELECTION :: The currently selected text in the current view.
  - ORG_LINENUM :: The current line number in the current view
  - ORG_FILENAME :: The filename of the current view

  These can be used in your snippet to add a rich variety to your captures:

  Here we will insert some properties with a link to your current location in the current view.
  The currently selected text inside a src block and the date you made this capture.

  *NOTE*: /In the following block, the github org parser gets confused with nested src blocks so I have formatted them funny so they will show up/

  #+BEGIN_SRC xml
        <snippet>
            <content><![CDATA[
        * NOTE ${1:HEADING}
          :PROPERTIES:
          :FROM:    [[file:${ORG_FILENAME}:${ORG_LINENUM}][Source]]
          :CREATED: $ORG_INACTIVE_DATE
          :END:
          $0
          # +begin_sr_c ${2:cpp}
          $ORG_SELECTION
          # +end_sr_c]]>
        </content>
            <tabTrigger>capture_heading</tabTrigger>
            <scope>text.orgmode</scope>
            <description>Capture Heading</description>
        </snippet>
  #+END_SRC 

* TODO Refile
  I like to capture ideas, snippets and meeting notes to my refile file.
  That makes input quick and dirty when I am in the middle of something else.

  However, once captured it is a pain to move that stuff around. Org has a 
  feature that lets you do that much easier. Refile. ~OrgRefile~ lets you
  quickly move a heading from one location to another within your known
  org files. 

* TODO Archive
  While projects are great, it is often useful to archive
  a project once completed. Org has a powerful toolset for
  archiving completed subtrees.

  *OrgArchiveSubtree* will take the subtree and put it in another file
  as an archived entry.

  As usual the org manual is the best source of truth about archiving:
  [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Archiving.html][Archiving]] 
  That said a quick primer:

  You can either add 
  TODO FILL IN FROM HERE
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
  #+END_EXAMPLE
