* Editing
  Quick editing options

** Formatting
   Org supports a bunch of formatting options.
   Where possible they have chosen formatting options
   that have the flavour of the format you are choosing.

   - *Bold*
   - _Underline_
   - /Italics/
   - +Strikethrough+
   - ~Code~
   - =Verbatim=

   These are most useful when writing org files for [[file:pandoc.org][Export]] 

** Tags
   *OrgInsertTag* tries to help with the rapid insertion of tags.
   The tooltip / suggestions are currently somewhat broken. I hope to improve this in the future.

** Todo Cycling
   Because changing the status of your task is something that you do
   quite often when using org as a means of organizing a project,
   org supports the means of quickly switching between task states.

   - OrgChangeTodo - Will let you quickly change the state of
     a task. I don't support cycling at the moment, only picking from
     a quick list.

** Scheduling
   Inserting dates and times is one of many things we do often in org.
   I have started working on a date picker that can help /somewhat/ with
   scheduling efforts.

** Check Boxes [1/3]

   Our org implementation has some basic support for checked lists.
   These are a weaker version of a heading.

   - [ ] Something that needs to be done.
   - [x] Something that is already done.
   - [-] Something partially done. [1/2]
     - [ ] Something to be done
     - [x] Done

   - *OrgRecalcAllCheckbox* - recalculate all checkboxes in view
   - *OrgCheckboxToggle*    - Toggle the checkbox and recalc
   - *OrgRecalcCheckbox*    - Recalc [/] boxes below this.

   In addition, *OrgToggle* is aware of checkboxes and will toggle the checkbox
