* Editing
  Quick editing options

** Formatting
   Org supports a bunch of formatting options.
   Where possible they have chosen formatting options
   that have the flavour of the format you are choosing.

   - *Bold*
   - _Underline_
   - /Italics/
   - +Strikethrough+
   - ~Code~
   - =Verbatim=

   These are most useful when writing org files for [[file:pandoc.org][Export]] 


** Todo Cycling
   Because changing the status of your task is something that you do
   quite often when using org as a means of organizing a project,
   org supports the means of quickly switching between task states.

   - OrgChangeTodo - Will let you quickly change the state of
     a task. I don't support cycling at the moment, only picking from
     a quick list.
