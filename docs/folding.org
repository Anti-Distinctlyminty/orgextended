** Tab Cycling

    One of the most important keybindings is org_tab_cycling
    This is a context aware tab mode that will handle tab insertion
    vs header collapsing.

    #+begin_src js

	{ 
	  "keys": ["tab"],               
	  "command": "org_tab_cycling",         
	  "context": [{ "key": "eol_selector", "operator": "equal", "operand": "text.orgmode" }]
	}

    #+end_src

    This single key binding enables the "magic" of org tab cycling.
    After you have enabled this some great things will be possible:

    - Pressing tab on a heading will cycle it through unfolded, folded, first level headings only
    - Pressing tab on a source block will fold it away so you don't have to look at it.
    - Pressing tab on [[file:properties.org][Properties]] and property drawers will automatically be folded for you.
    - Pressing tab on [[file:links.org][Links]] will fold the links away for you so you don't have to see the full link.
    - Pressing tab outside of any headings will cycle the entire document through Overview, Table Of "Contents" view and Show All modes.
      This is a very powerful way to quick get a view of your document from a birds eye view. 

** Global Tab Cycling
    - Global tab cycling can be done at the top of the document, but it can also be done on any heading
      by pressing *shift+tab*
    - This can often be useful as a quick way of narrowing your focus to just a single heading.
      In emacs I would narrow the buffer to just the current subtree. We cannot do that in sublime
      so, second best is to fold everything other than the heading you want to work on.

** Commands
   Sublime Org Mode supports quite a few commands:

   - OrgFoldAll        - Fold everything in the file.
   - OrgUnfoldAll      - Unfold everything in the file. 
   - OrgFoldContents   - Fold all the contents of all the headings (Table Of Contents view)
   - OrgRemoveAllFolds - Remove all the folds in the file (show everything)
   - OrgFoldThing      - Fold an item within a heading (drawer, block etc)
   - OrgFoldAllLinks   - Fold all links within the document

   These commands can be bound to keybindings of your choice to help you naviate the file.

** Caveats
    Occasionally you can get yourself into a bad folding state.
    I am working to ensure these cannot happen, however, since we use custom folds
    sometimes your folds can be made or shift to wonky places. 
    IF this happens, re-save your file and run the *OrgRemoveAllFolds* command. 

    This will update the backing representation of the file and clear all folds from the file.
