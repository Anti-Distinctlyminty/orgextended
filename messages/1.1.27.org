** Archiving
	- Fixed a bug where ARCHIVE_TIME was missing a colon at the front when inserted.
	- Switched archiving to save as utf-8 by default to avoid some of the unicode problems I have been running into.

** Editing
	- Org Insert Now Active     - Inserts right now as an active datetime 
	- Org Insert Now Inactive   - Inserts right now as an inactive datetime
	- Org Insert Date Active    - Pops up the date picker to insert an active datetime
	- Org Insert Date Inactive  - Pops up the date picker to insert an inactive datetime

	- Dynamic Block Snippet:
	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  <b
	#+END_EXAMPLE

** Spreadsheet Preview V11

	- date() function improved to auto convert strings and cells to OrgDate objects.
	- duration() added to handle columnview duration syntax. This is compatible with adding to dates.
	- if statements work although they do not follow the calc style, here we are diverging a little at the moment
	  due to the fact that our backend is really python ast. "If" is a keyword, I can't easily use it like a function without playing
	  some games I am not sure I am ready to do.
	- percentages can be treated like numbers much like they can in orgmode

** Columnview
	- Empty properties still make a row in the column view (allowing you to setup additional rows for calculations)
	- Table format blocks can live after the end marker on a dynamic block. This is not org standard but it lets us
	  build formulas for generated tables which can be really handy on clock tables and columnviews (building timesheets and project plans)
	- Org syntax is turned on inside a dynamic block now allowing tables to be highlighted inside the block.
