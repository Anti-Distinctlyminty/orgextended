* 1.1.23
** Configuration
  - orgDirs - in 1.1.22 we added support for directory globbing. We have added a little more error handling in 1.1.23 to
    detect single stars rather than double stars and to not throw in those cases.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      D:\mypath\**\   - This is supported

      D:\mypath\*\   - This is NOT supported
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** Source Blocks
    - Improved handling of unsaved files when executing source blocks.
      NOTE: Sublime WILL save the file for you if it has already been saved, or
            error out.

*** GraphViz Blocks

    - added engine (neato, dot, etc)
    - added fmt (jpg, ps, png)	

    #+BEGIN_SRC graphviz :fmt jpg :engine neato :file graphviz.jpg
     digraph G {
       a -> b;
       a -> c;
       c -> d
     } 
    #+END_SRC

*** Ditaa Src Blocks
    To use:
    Add the path to ditaa.jar from sourceforge in your settings file:

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      "ditaa": "<pathto>/ditaa.jar",   
    #+END_EXAMPLE

    Create a source block with your diagram.
    (Nope, we don't have an artist mode for sublime yet)

    #+BEGIN_SRC ditaa :file ditaa.png
    +--------+       +----------+
    | Hello  | ----> | Hello2   |
    +--------+       +----------+
    #+END_SRC 

    Execute the block and you should now have a diagram!
