* 1.1.0
** Scheduling
	- Support active timestamps vs SCHEDULED
	  SCHEDULED is when you want to start on a task
	  while tasks with a timestamp are scheduled at a point in time.

	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	    ** TODO Heading
	       SCHEDULED: <startdate>  <-- This will appear in the agenda until you close the task
	    ** TODO HEADING
	       <date>  <-- This will appear in the agenda but only at the date specified
	  #+END_EXAMPLE

	- BREAKING CHANGE
	  Before I would only show tasks, these are items with an open TODO state.
	  Now, by default anything that has an active timestamp or is scheduled will
	  show up in the agenda UNLESS you set that view to :onlytasks as a parameter.
	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	    ** HEADING
	       <date>  <-- This will now appear in the agenda where before it would not
	  #+END_EXAMPLE

	  #+BEGIN_SRC js
      "AgendaCustomViews": 
      {
        "Default": ["Calendar", "Week", "Day : onlytasks", "Blocked Projects", "Next Tasks", "Loose Tasks"],
        "Todos":   ["Todos"],
      }
	  #+END_SRC

	  Note the onlytasks parameter, that will filter out non tasks from the Day view in my
	  default agenda view.

	- DEADLINE is still not supported but support should be comming in a future release.
