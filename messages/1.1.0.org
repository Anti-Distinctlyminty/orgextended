* 1.1.0
** Scheduling
	- Support active timestamps vs SCHEDULED
	  SCHEDULED is when you want to start on a task
	  while tasks with a timestamp are scheduled at a point in time.
	- BREAKING CHANGE
	  Before I would only show tasks, these are items with an open TODO state.
	  Now, by default anything that has an active timestamp or is scheduled will
	  show up in the agenda UNLESS you set that view to :onlyTasks as a parameter.
	- DEADLINE is still not supported but support should be comming in a future release.
