* 1.2.0
	- Documentation moved out of the repository to its own repository
	  this was done to shrink the size of the package.
	- Turned off logger that was accidentally left on.
	- Added "openas": "direct" to capture definitions. This will
	  open the capture directly in the file at the target location.
	- Added  "agendaFirstDay" and "agendaWeekViewNumDays" to settings to allow
	  users to start the week view from monday rather than sunday and limit the
	  week view to just a 5 day view rather than 7 days if desired.
	- Cleaned up a bunch of old debugging output.
	- Working on named targets for blocks in the parser, this is to facilitate
	  eventual chainging of inputs in the bable execution. 
  - Fixed archive notation to work without the colon separator.
  - added <q and <v quote and verse snippets
  - Added these release notes
  - Improved settings to use the new settings ui.
  - Changed docs link in settings to open the docs repo rather than
    opening the docs in sublime.
  - Fixed global tab cycling on first line of file.
  - agendaFirstDay can now be the english name of a day of the week OR an integer.
  - Month view in the agenda now respects agendaFirstDay
  - PRIORITIES comment is now respected in change priority command
  - STARTUP comment now recurses
  - WARNING: orgextended.sublime-syntax renamed to OrgExtended. This is so the
  	title appears as OrgExtended in the syntax list on the bottom right of sublime.
  	This can caust errors when loading sublime with an old settings file.
  	Please carefully rename your settings file and close all org tabs.
  - Fixed a number of issues when loading as a zipped package. Export should
    work from a package again.
