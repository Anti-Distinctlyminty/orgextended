* 1.1.20
** Editing
	- Heading and Child heading insertion now ignores whitespace at the end of a node
** Extensions
	- Improved extension reloading on modification. Before it would force reload to often
	  now we track and reload only when we have to. This should improve table performance
	  a little. This is in prep for the advanced table features including automatic
	  cell calculations on # fields.
	- Extension folders renamed for consistency:
		- src folder renamed to orgsrc
		- resolver folder renamed to orgresolver
		- dynamic folder renamed to orgdynamic
		- table extensions were already in orgtable
** Spreadsheets Preview V7
	- Fixed small issue with syntax coloring

** Syntax
	- Added lisp coloring for source blocks
