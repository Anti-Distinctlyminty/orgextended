* 1.1.20
** Editing
	- Heading and Child heading insertion now ignores whitespace at the end of a node
** Extensions
	- Improved extension reloading on modification. Before it would force reload to often
	  now we track and reload only when we have to. This should improve table performance
	  a little. This is in prep for the advanced table features including automatic
	  cell calculations on # fields.
