* 1.2.1

	Just like 1.2.0 was focused on supporting tables 1.3.0 has a focus on better
	babel support.

	Core Idea for 1.2.1: More language handlers supporting table data sources. 

	This is a fairly simple first step into the world of babel. The GNU Plot handler
	paved the way for this we are just adding the same support to the other handlers.

	Right now we only really have python and powershell handlers anyways.
	As this matures we will document how to add your own language handlers as well
	as extend the list of supported languages.

** Lists
	- fixed a bug with unordered list sorting including source blocks.	

** Python	
	Python now supports tables as data sources. True babel execution
	would auto format the output or provide controls over how we handle the output
	but... these are our first steps here.
	
	#+NAME: p-data
	| a | b | c | d | e |
	|---+---+---+---+---|
	| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
	| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 0 |

	#+BEGIN_SRC python :var DATA=p-data
	  print(str(DATA))
	#+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
  [['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]]
 
** Powershell
    #+BEGIN_SRC powershell :var DATA=p-data
      $DATA | % {"$_"} 
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
   a b c d e
   1 2 3 4 5
   6 7 8 9 0

** List Data Sources Within a File.
	Source blocks are also getting list as as data sources:
	Notice that the indented item is excluded this is normal org behaviour with lists.

  #+NAME: l-data
  - b
  - a
  	- a
  - c

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :var DATA=l-data
    print(str(DATA))
  #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   ['b', 'a', 'c']
    
   #+BEGIN_SRC powershell :var DATA=l-data
      ,$DATA 
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   b
   a
   c

** Numbered List Data Sources Within a File.
	Numbered lists are also now potential data sources:

	#+NAME: n-data
	1. b
	2. a 
	3. c
	  4. 4 
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC python :var DATA=n-data
    print(str(DATA))
  #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   ['b', 'a', 'c']
    
   #+BEGIN_SRC powershell :var DATA=n-data
      ,$DATA 
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   b
   a
   c
