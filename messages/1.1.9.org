*** Improved DWIM Additions to Numbered lists   
    A numbered list preceded by a normal list was confusing
    DWIM extension. The system was putting the new entry
    above the unordered list.

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - This would disrupt DWIM editing of the list below
    - DWIM was finding this list and thinking it was part
    - of the numbered list.
    1. I am extending this list
    2. This is the list I am extending
    #+END_EXAMPLE   

    The same thing could happen for example blocks or src blocks.
        
*** Improved Alternate Additions to Lists
    - Ctrl+Shift+Enter is an extended insert
      For numbered lists it will extend the list vs insert where you are.
    - This should now work for all the list types.
