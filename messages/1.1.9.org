*** Improved DWIM Additions to Numbered lists	
	A numbered list preceded by a normal list was confusing
	DWIM extension. The system was putting the new entry
	above the unordered list.

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    - This would disrupt DWIM editing of the list below
    - DWIM was finding this list and thinking it was part
    - of the numbered list.
    1. I am extending this list
    2. This is the list I am extending
	#+END_EXAMPLE	

	The same thing could happen for example blocks or src blocks.
