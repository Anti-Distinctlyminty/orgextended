* 1.1.29

   Core Idea: Add GNU Plot Script Blocks

   - [x] Add a syntax for gnu plot script blocks if one does not already exist
   - [x] Add a src handler to execute these script blocks.


   Here is some gnu plot code that draws a sine wave.
   #+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :file gantt-table.png
    # We don't need a key (or legend) for this simple graph.
    set key off
 
    # Set the title for the graph.
    set title "Sine against Phase"
  
    # We want the graph to cover a full sine wave.
    set xrange [0:6.28]
  
    # Set the label for the X axis.
    set xlabel "Phase (radians)"
  
    # Draw a horizontal centreline.
    set xzeroaxis
  
    # Pure sine wave amplitude ranges from +1 to -1.
    set yrange [-1:1]
  
    # No tick-marks are needed for the Y-axis .
    unset ytics
  
    # Plot the curve.
    plot sin(x) 
   #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:gantt-table.png]]

  - Params for src blocks have been converted to use the new PList system added in 1.1.28
  - Source Blocks now have a PreProcessSourceFile() method that allows for injection of file and other paramters into the source block.

** Powershell Block Execute Bug
	- this was using the OrgExtended package dir as it's cwd
	  which was causing problems when running as a package. FIXED.
