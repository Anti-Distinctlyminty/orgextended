* 1.1.25
** Source Block Diagrams
  - Non existent subdirs are auto-created
  - Execute block works on any line inside the source block as well as on the fence.
  - Evaluating a block on the last line of the file was not inserting the RESULTS tag.
  - Repeated re-evaluation kept adding newlines at the end.
  - When evaluating source with a diagram the cursor could move, this is now fixes.

    #+BEGIN_SRC graphviz :file thisdirdoesnotexist/graphviz.png
     digraph G {
       a -> b;
       a -> c;
       c -> d;
     } 
    #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:thisdirdoesnotexist\graphviz.png]]

** Customization
  - Support single directory wildcards:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "orgDirs": "C:\Mypath\*\SubFolder"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Will match a single folder wildcard like so:

  - C:\Mypath\foo\SubFolder\x.org
  - C:\Mypath\bar\SubFolder\y.org
  - C:\Mypath\baz\SubFolder\z.org

  Again, this can increase your startup time dramatically. Please use with caution!
