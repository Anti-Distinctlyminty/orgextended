** Source Block Diagrams
  - Non existent subdirs are auto-created
  - Execute block works on any line inside the source block as well as on the fence.
  - Evaluating a block on the last line of the file was not inserting the RESULTS tag.
  - Repeated re-evaluation kept adding newlines at the end.
  - When evaluating source with a diagram the cursor could move, this is now fixes.

    #+BEGIN_SRC graphviz :file thisdirdoesnotexist/graphviz.png
     digraph G {
       a -> b;
       a -> c;
       c -> d;
     } 
    #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:thisdirdoesnotexist\graphviz.png]]

** Customization
  - Support single directory wildcards:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "orgDirs": "C:\Mypath\*\SubFolder"
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Will match a single folder wildcard like so:

  - C:\Mypath\foo\SubFolder\x.org
  - C:\Mypath\bar\SubFolder\y.org
  - C:\Mypath\baz\SubFolder\z.org

  Again, this can increase your startup time dramatically. Please use with caution!

** Spreadsheet Preview V10
  - boxes mode seems to work.

*** Start of Advanced Table Features
    - Auto computed cells now mostly work.
      Careful with these in big tables.
      They only auto compute when you use tab or shift tab
      to move between cells, arrow keys do not recompute
    - Row names seem to work work.
    - Above and Below names seem to work
    - Symbol rows seem to work
