** Folding
	- Fixed a bug where buffers that are lacking a filename
	  can still be folded.
** Clocking
	new setting: 
		- clockingSubMinuteClocks: true will now keep clocking entries that are smaller than a minute
** Movement
	- Fixed move heading up / move heading down. This now does the same
	  as org-move-subtree-up and org-move-subtree-down.
	  - Moves headings within siblings at the same level of the tree.
