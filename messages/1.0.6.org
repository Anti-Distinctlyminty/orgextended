* 1.0.6
** Color Scheme Generator
	This is a bit of an experimental feature to help people
	use org mode with their own color scheme. It is NOTE complete
	and not where I want it to be yet. This does not yet touch the agenda
	or the data picker, but I do eventually intend to work on those as well.

	I feel like orgmode should respect your chosen color scheme!

	- Org Create Color Scheme From Active

	When run from a normal NON org mode buffer will sample the currently
	active color scheme, create a new color scheme file in:

	#+BEGIN_QUOTE
	  Packages/User/OrgColorSchems/<originalName>_Org.sublime-color-scheme
	#+END_QUOTE

	It will then add a couple of key scopes such as:

	- orgmode.preamble :: which is used to make the leading stars invisible on a subheading
	- orgmode.state.*  :: These are used to give the core built in states some color

	This also adds a comment block in the color scheme file that tries to help new users understand
	what their options are. Note this is based off your active color scheme.

	This will ALSO change the active OrgExtended color scheme to be this new color scheme to let you
	see how it is going to pan out. This may, or may NOT work out well for you!
