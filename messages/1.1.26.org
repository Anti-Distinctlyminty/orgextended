** Properties
	- New Command: "Org Create Heading Id"
	  This will add a UUID ID to the current heading.
	- Db handling of ids reworked a little to support jumping to an ID or a CUSTOM_ID
	- New Command: "Org Insert Effort"
	  Must be org duration format. Will insert an effort property
	  defaultEffortEstimateUnit - setting (defaults to d) can be used to set the default effort unit 

** Spreadsheets Preview V11
	- remote function can now take a custom id or id as per:
	  [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-01/msg00420.html][Remote Table References]] 
	- Nodes now have a table property that lists the position of the first table in the node.
    - It doesn't really work well because the existing table system requires a view, which means that we have to load the file
      which cannot easily be done during the execution of a formula. This means you can get odd tab swaps if you have a remote reference
      and the file is not opened. I will have to think about another way of handling this in the future.
