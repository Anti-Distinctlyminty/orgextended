** Folding
	- Block folding inside a block was driving me nuts
	  I have changed it so you can only fold a dynamic block or a source block from its header
	  If this bothers you, we can make this configurable, just let me know.

	- New Command: "Org Create Heading Id"
	  This will add a UUID ID to the current heading.
	- Db handling of ids reworked a little to support jumping to an ID or a CUSTOM_ID
	- New Command: "Org Insert Effort"
	  Must be org duration format. Will insert an effort property
	  defaultEffortEstimateUnit - setting (defaults to d) can be used to set the default effort unit

	- remote function can now take a custom id or id as per:
	  [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-01/msg00420.html][Remote Table References]] 
	- Nodes now have a table property that lists the position of the first table in the node.
    - It doesn't really work well because the existing table system requires a view, which means that we have to load the file
      which cannot easily be done during the execution of a formula. This means you can get odd tab swaps if you have a remote reference
      and the file is not opened. I will have to think about another way of handling this in the future.

** [#B] ColumnView Dynamic Block
   :PROPERTIES:
     :EFFORT: 1d
   :END:
   [2021-03-09 Tue 11:00]

   Part of the reason for the tags, priorities and effort markers is to show the new column view
   dynamic block. It is still in its infancy. It has none of the summary functionality of the real
   column view. It also only has a limited set of handlers. It can access properties and has the following
   built in handlers:


   - ALLTAGS	  All tags, including inherited ones.
   - CLOSED	    When was this entry closed?
   - DEADLINE  	The deadline timestamp.
   - FILE      	The filename the entry is located in.
   - ITEM      	The headline of the entry.
   - PRIORITY 	The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.
   - SCHEDULED 	The scheduling timestamp.
   - TAGS     	The tags defined directly in the headline.
   - TIMESTAMP 	The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.
   - TIMESTAMP_IA 	The first inactive timestamp in the entry.
   - TODO         	The TODO keyword of the entry.

   Parameters that work:

   - hlines
   - maxdepth
   - id (local, global, ID value, file:)

	I don't have column mode yet, but we will get something like it eventually.
