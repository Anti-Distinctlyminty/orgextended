* 1.1.5
** Stability and Performance
	- Fixed some issues in the agenda with old SCHEDULED: values
		We would search forward in time forever trying to find
		a match in the agenda. This could make org files with REALLY old
		SCHEDULED tasks that were not closed take a long time to render in the agenda.

		I have now capped it. 4 Months is the default:
		This goes for deadlines, active timestamps and scheduled values.

		In addition I have enabled some caching for following repeat rules
		which should improve overall performance here.

		#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		agendaMaxScheduledIterations: 120
		#+END_EXAMPLE

	- Working to improve handling of dates without times in the agenda.
	  This could cause some assertions in some of the new scheduled and deadline handling systems
	  I believe I have all the asserts now but I am working on ensuring intuitive behaviour.

    - Fixed display of plain (no time) DEADLINES, they now show the due date properly
    - Fixed closing of plain (no time) DEADLINES, they would assert before when trying to update the time.
