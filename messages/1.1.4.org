* 1.1.4
** Editing
	- Changed default keybinding. Capture is now Alt+o z to mirror neovintageous mode with Z
		(it also did not work before due to other Alt+o c ... commands)
** Stability
	- Removed legacy automatic copy of settings files to User folder now that we are using
	  the new dual pane settings mechanic. This was causing an assert on startup for 
	  users on ST3.
	- Active timestamps with ranges were not showing up in the agenda properly.
	  This was due to how the timestamps were querried. Should now be fixed.
	- Closed Scheduled timestamps would show up in the week view even after the scheduled date.
	  this was a byproduct of the new scheduled behaviour and has been fixed. When closed
	  the items will show up ONLY for the date they were scheduled. (They do not reflect)
	  the date at which they were closed. In the future I hope to make that happen. NOTE:
	  they do not show up in the day view at the moment. I will work to improve that in a future
	  release.
	- Toggling a task to done with a recurring timestamp will set the LAST_REPEAT and LOGBOOK
	  entries properly now and will update the base timestamp.
