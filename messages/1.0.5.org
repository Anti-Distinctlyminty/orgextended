** Syntax Highlighting
	- Bash blocks uses embed to allow them to escape properly
	- Core syntax (not agenda and picker) now support standard syntax markers
	  - NOTE: Not all features are supported or colored. Existing OrgExtended
	          color schemes are still the preferred means of viewing an org file.
	  - Eventual goal is to take an existing active color scheme and provide a tool to
	    extend it to support all the org coloring. This is a first step in that direction.
	- Created languagelist.yaml to make it easier to add new languages to the syntax.
