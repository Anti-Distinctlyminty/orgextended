* 1.2.4

	Core Idea: Value vs Output execution

** Links Improvements
   By default most file links will be loaded within sublime.
   If there is a file type you want launched outside of sublime use:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     "file_exclude_pattern": ["*.pdf"],
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Column View
  - Fixed a problem where the columnview dynamic block was grabbing its column definitions
    from the current node. This would cause column view to use the default definition.

	 #+COLUMNS: %TODO(To do) %ITEM(Task) %TAGS(Tags) %Effort(effort)
   #+BEGIN: columnview :id global :indent t
   | TODO | Task          | Tags | effort |
   |      | 1.2.4         |      |        |
   | DONE | ..Column View |      |        |
   #+END:

** Value Type Execution

  Acts like a function, the return statement of the code is returned.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :results value
      print("Hello world")
      print("Hello world2")
      if 5 < 10:
        print("hi")
      return 11
  #+END_SRC
   #+RESULTS:
   : 11
    
   #+BEGIN_SRC powershell :results value
     Write-Host "Hello World"
     return 10
   #+END_SRC
   #+RESULTS:
   : 10

** Chainging Execution

  A src block should be able to reference another src block
