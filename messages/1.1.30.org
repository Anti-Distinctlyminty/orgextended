* 1.1.30
	Core Idea: Testing pass on tables to ensure what is there is relatively usable.

** Spreadsheet Preview V14
	- added bool(cell) int(cell) float(cell) methods to convert string cells to boolean, ints and floats explicitly if desired
	- added highlight(cell,color,text) which highlights a cell a specific color for you
	- added passed(test) that will highlight a target cell green or red and write PASSED or FAILED into the cell for unit testing purposes.
	- added unit tests org file for tables.
	- Execute table now restores the cursor after the evaluation of the table improving usability.
	- Fixed assert when cursor was on a formula during table formula execution due to call to table_editor_align requiring the cursor be in the table
	- Fixed a bug with <= not evaluating properly next to a cell name ($1<=$2 would fail)
	- Added Org Execute All Tables - scans the whole file for tables and executes all of them.
	- Improved all date functions handling of datestrings
	- Fixed double digit row index parsing, @10$2 was failing to parse properly sometimes.
