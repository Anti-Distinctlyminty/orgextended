* 1.1.30
	Core Idea: Testing pass on tables to ensure what is there is relatively usable.

** Spreadsheet Preview V14
	- added:
		- bool(cell)
		- int(cell)
		- float(cell) 
		to convert string cells to boolean, ints and floats explicitly if desired

	- added highlight(cell,color,text) which highlights a cell a specific color for you
	- added passed(test) that will highlight a target cell
	  green or red and write PASSED or FAILED into the cell. We are using this for unit testing at the moment.

	- added unit tests org file for tables.
	- Execute table now restores the cursor after the evaluation of the table improving usability.
	- Fixed assert when cursor was on a formula during table formula execution due to call 
	  to table_editor_align requiring the cursor be in the table
	- Fixed a bug with <= not evaluating properly next to a cell name ($1<=$2 would fail)
	- Added Org Execute All Tables - scans the whole file for tables and executes all of them.
	- Improved all date functions handling of datestrings
	- Fixed double digit row index parsing, @10$2 was failing to parse properly sometimes.
	- Fixed a bug with vmedian where it would sometimes not compute the median!

	- More docs including a little view of the new highlight in action in a unit test capture: (at the bottom of the tables doc)
	[[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended_docs/blob/master/tables.org][Tables]]	

	- New documentation on adding the emacs constants.el to your table experience in docs
	[[https://github.com/ihdavids/orgextended_docs/blob/master/mathconstants.org][Math Constants]] 

** GNU Plot
	- Calling "Org Plot Table" on the #+PLOT: header rather than the table would cause problems.
