	Core Idea - Better output support and results controls

** Column View
  - Fixed a small regression introduced in plists in some of the earlier babel work.
    This was impacting columnview

** Test File
  To help new users we now have an:

  "Org Show Testfile" command that will quickly create a testfile for a user to play with.

** Output Formatting

*** Drawer Formatter
   will wrap output in a drawer

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :results drawer verbatim :var x=5
     print("Hello World")
     print(x)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   :results:
   Hello World
   5
   :end:

*** Code Formatter
    will generate a code block with the output:

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :results code
     print(str([1,2,3,4,5]))
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_src python
   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   #+end_src
   
*** Org Mode Formatter
    will generate a code block specific to org

   #+BEGIN_SRC python :results org
     print("#+COMMENT: org data here")
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   #+begin_src org
   #+COMMENT: org data here
   #+end_src
