* 1.1.8
** Editing
	- DWIM editing of numbered lists has improved slightly
	  Fixed some bugs with lists at the end of a buffer
	  or with a blank line above the list.
    - DWIM editing of standard unordered lists (not checkbox)
      is now supported properly.
    - Indent and DeIndent somewhat work on lists (tabs vs spaces are
      still a little problematic)
