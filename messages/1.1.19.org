	- Added the ability to add your own functions

	Create a file with the name of your function in:

	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	Packages/User/orgtable/<yourfunction>.py
	#+END_EXAMPLE

	Here I have created a file called now.py:

	#+BEGIN_SRC python
    def Execute():
	    import sublime
	    import datetime
	    return str(datetime.datetime.now())
	#+END_SRC	

	The module will be run dynamically so your imports are best to put in the function as seen above.
	If your function takes cells they should be parameters to Execute.

	In my example I am returning the current datetime as a string:

	| 2021-03-03 12:42:03.720657 | b | c | d | e |
	| 2021-03-03 12:42:03.738691 |   |   |   |   |
    #+TBLFM:$1=now()

    I will have further examples in the documentation going forward.

    - Fixed a couple of asserts found when navigating tables.

   	This feature is considered an advanced feature and is disabled by default in your settings file.

   	#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "enableTableExtensions": true,
   	#+END_EXAMPLE	

** Checkboxes
  :PROPERTIES:
    :COOKIE_DATA: recursive
  :END:

  Recursive todo summary data. NOTE: this counts ALL checkboxes as if they are part of the parent checkbox not just leaves.
  This can be set using the COOKIE_DATA property above or using the global setting:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      checkboxSummaryRecursive  
  #+END_EXAMPLE

 - [-] Testing parent	[3/6]
   - [x] A
   - [-] B
   	- [ ] C 
   	- [x] D
   	- [x] E
   - [ ] F
