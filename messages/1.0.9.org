* 1.0.9
** Editing
	- Org Select Subtree 
	  This will select the full subtree of the active heading.
		- alt+o m s 
		- <space> m s (neovintageous normal mode)
    - Org Select Entity
      This will select just the current node
        - alt+o m e    (mark entity)
        - <space> m e  (neovintageous normal mode)
    - Org Copy Subtree
      This will copy the entire subtree to the clipboard.
        - alt+o y s    (yank entity)
        - <space> y s  (neovintageous normal mode)
    - Org Copy Entity
      This will copy the current node to the clipboard.
        - alt+o y e    (yank entity)
        - <space> y e  (neovintageous normal mode)

** Folding
  - Fixed link tab cycling.  
  
** Color Scheme Generator
  - The generator is now able to handle simple tmTheme files.

    NOTE: it converts them to sublime-color-scheme files in the output
          folder.

  - Added Org Select Color Scheme menu item to switch Org between color schemes
    you have already generated. NOTE: same caveats hold about having org files
    open when switching. Sublime does not automatically switch existing views.

** NeoVintageous
	- For ST4 users - neovintageous has upgraded to python 3.8
	  this means that my hacks to push register 0 with the values
	  of the system clipboard aren't working until I upgrade OrgExtended.

	  I will attempt to make that a priority for those that care.
