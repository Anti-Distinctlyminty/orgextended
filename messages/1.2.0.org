* 1.2.0
	Core Idea: I am considering the spreadsheet feature out of preview now.
               most of the core org features with spreadsheets are now supported.

** Spreadsheets Beta
  More core functions

  - atan
  - acos
  - asin
  - degrees
  - radians
  - sqrt
  - pow
  - log
  - log10
  - log2

** Editing
  - New Command: "Org Insert Archive Tag" will add the :ARCHIVE: Tag to a node. Not currently bound to a key.
  - ARCHIVE tag gets filtered out by default in agenda. This means archived TODO's do not accidentally show up if you have a FILETAG on your archive file.
 
** Tags
  - FILETAGS comment is now respected properly as an inheritied tag on a heading. 

** Notifications
  - Notifications system now respects the ARCHIVE tag.
