* 1.0.4 HTML Exporter Improvements
	- #+CAPTION comments export a custom figure for tables and images.
		- At the moment captions are always t-above style.
		- Figures are done with a div and span pair. 
		- Styles include: .figure .figure-number and caption.t-above and caption.table-number
	- #+AUTHOR, #+TITLE, #+EMAIL, #+LANGUAGE tags have rudimentary support although very
	  rough.
	- #+NAME is stripped out of output properly.
