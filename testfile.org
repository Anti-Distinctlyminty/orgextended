* Introduction
  This is a simple test file that tries to demonstrate some
  of the syntax highlighting and allows me to play with things.

 
* Basic Headings and tags  :TAG1:TAG2:

  To start I am only supporting 7 levels of headers.
  This seems sufficient for my needs. Tags are supported
** Heading 2
*** Heading 3 :TAG3:
**** Heading 4
***** Heading 5
****** Heading 6 :TAG4:

* NOTE Notes and phone messages :OTHERTAGS:
  I have not found a good way to make the normal TODO states dynamic
  as supported in org mode, so you get the states I like and care about.
  Feel free to add and PR your additional states.
** PHONE Phone messages
   Some text in here
*** MEETING Meetings

* Property blocks are colored
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ORDERED:  t
  :END:
  :LOGBOOK:
  - This is a line
  :END:
  For clocking we need a property drawer concept so here is a start.

* NOTE orgmode (vs true orgmode compat) bits
  These items are NOT true org mode things but come
  from the previous ST2 orgmode package. I felt they were worth
  supporting and have kept them. I do not think being purist is
  super helpful when it comes to helping out the sublime community

* NOTE Lists

  - Basic unordered list
  - More stuff

  + Plus unordered list
  + More stuff

  1. Numbered list
  2. More stuff

  - Definition1 :: This is what it means
  - Definition2 :: This is what that means

* NOTE Checkboxes [33%]
  Colored but not updated yet! I need Ctrl-c Ctrl-c style updating.
  That will come, just not yet.

  - [ ] Checkbox
  - [x] Blocked checkbox
  - [-] Checked checkbox [1/3]
      - [ ] sub
      - [ ] sub2
      - [x] sub3

* NOTE Links

  [[file:C:\Users\ihdav\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages\OrgExtended\testfile.org::#33da3712-51b7-485c-b69d-f54dd266543f][ID Creation]] 
  [[file:C:\Users\ihdav\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text\Packages\OrgExtended\testfile.org::#My-Custom-Id][Custom Id]] 

	There is support for basic org links a la orgmode style.

	[[https://reg.ca][Reg Ca]] Org link

  NOTE: Folding is not perfect but I find folding the actual ref itself
        is a reasonable compromise.

  Pressing enter on the link will try to do the right thing.
  [[file:./docs/links.org::#a-unique-id][Custom Id Link]]

  This is a link to a target internal to an org file
  [[Target1][Link To Target1]]
  [[testfile.org::Target1][Link To Target1]]

  Links to headings
  [[file:testfile.org::*Scheduling][Scheduling]]
  [[file:*Scheduling][Scheduling]]

  Links to named objects
  [[MyNamedObject][Link to Named Object]]
  [[testfile.org::MyNamedObject][Link to Named Object]]

* NOTE Scheduling

  These are colored and parsed by the system
  but not yet integrated fully.

  CLOSED: [2020-05-25 Mon]
  DEADLINE: <2020-05-25 Tue>

* NOTE Navigation

  Ctrl arrow key travels up and down the tree of headings
  Jump in file.

* NOTE Refile, Copy

  I have commands for this but not bound well yet
  I am currently missing archiving.

* NOTE Control Tags
   Most of these are not supported by the backend yet.
   Where possible I WILL Support them and document them
   
   #+PRIORITIES: A B C
   #+TITLE: Orgmode example file
   
* TODO Src Block
	Working on supporting a variety of source code block styles.
	Hopefully I can support some of the babel engine as well eventually

	With the way org works the OrgExtended.sublime-color-scheme has to own your
	ENTIRE color scheme. You can override any of it by providing your own sublime color scheme.

	I have cheated here and pulled form the Monokai Extended tmTheme (I always found that language, theme confusing when it is a color scheme not theme)
	I find monokai a bit jarring so I may provide several schemes eventually, we will see

### Markdown
    But rules have to be followed here so things have to be right aligned in the block.
```cpp
    printf("");
```
 #+END_SRC 

* NOTE Bold Italics Underline

    *bold*
    /italic/
    _underline_
    +strikethrough+
    ~code~
    =verbatim=


* NOTE Example, Verse, Quote, Center
	I use these a bunch to delineate a block of text I care about
	in my notes. I am going to keep these for now.

    #+begin_example
    This is an example of something
    in a block
    #+end_example

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    This is a quote from something.
    #+END_QUOTE

    #+BEGIN_VERSE
    A verse of poetry
    #+END_VERSE

    #+BEGIN_CENTER
    A verse of poetry
    #+END_CENTER

* NOTE Capture
  One of the biggest features I can't do without is the quick capture keybindings and templates.
  I have a system for this in place. It will probably change as I discover what I like here.
  I have a little template engine that is expanding as I discover what I need. It is NOTE quite like org
  as we are workingin sublime here.

* NOTE [#TOP] Priorities
   General priority tags work
   but a, b, c, d, e have independent
   coloring options in the grammar.
** TODO [#A] Top priority
   A body for this work item
*** NEXT [#B] Second priority
**** TODO [#C] Third priorty item
***** TODO [#D] Third priorty item
****** BLOCKED [#E] Third priorty item

* This has no priorities

* Inline Images
  Links can be used to show images or open
  up an image viewer if followed.

  Run: OrgShowImage on this link
  #+CAPTION: This is a caption for this image
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 200
  [[file:./images/orgstart.gif]]

* Table Editor
  Eventually we will probably have to own table editing
  (At least if I want full support for expressions, which I do.)

  However, for now, the Sublime Table Editor plugin
  is pretty much full basic table editing support. It just needs
  a little tweaking to get working, I have just made it a dependency
  and embedded it into our generic tab cycling for now.

  #+CAPTION: This is a table caption
  |   Heading 1    | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
  |----------------+-----------+-----------|
  | Some data      |         1 |         3 |
  | More data      |         2 |         4 |
  |----------------+-----------+-----------|
  | Something else |         5 |         6 |

* Clocking
  #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :level 2
  |Heading|Time|
  |-
  |A|B|
  #+END:
** Clocking
   :PROPERTIES:
    CLOCK: [2020-03-31 Tue 16:28]--[2020-03-31 Tue 16:29] => 00:01
    CLOCK: [2020-03-31 Tue 20:39]--[2020-03-31 Tue 20:55] => 00:16
   :END:
   We can clock in and out now.

* Dynamic Blocks
  We will have to handle these differently than regular dynamic blocks
  
  #+BEGIN: insertdatetime
  If you run this, this text will be replaced with the current datetime
  #+END:

  #+BEGIN: clocktable :scope subtree :level 2
  This is a dynamic block
  #+END:

  1. Not in the list below
* Numbered Lists
  1. Carrots
  2. Beets
  3. Rhubarb
     1. Pie
     2. Crumble
     3. Is there something here?
  4. Yogurt
     1. Greek
  5. Cheese
  6. Goats Milk
